# Java-SerialX
SerialX is a powerful tool to serialize objects in Java.
SerialX is improving regular Java Base64 serialization and adding serialization protocols that you can create for objects that cant be serialized using regular way. For example final non-serializable objects or 3rd party objects. SerialX is also JSON like "programing" that are objects serialized in to. It also allows you to serialize multiple objects in to one string/file. Unlike to JSON, SerialX is based on determinate order of arguments or values we can say.
